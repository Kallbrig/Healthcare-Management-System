# Healthcare Management System
 Healthcare Management System built using Django for a CS-4454 - Secure Software Development course.
 
This was a 4 person group project.

# What I learned
* This project was my first experience with a framework. I leaned a good deal about frameworks in general as well as Django specifically.
* I learned about using Django to save and retrieve data out of a database. This caused a lot of headaches.
* I learned about working within a team to complete the project.
* I learned about virtual environments.
* I learned more about best practices using Git and Github.

# My thoughts
This project was a headache from beginning to end. As the class was Secure Software Development, I leaned very little about the topic. This project was more a lesson in solving problems than any previous project. Learning to work with a group was also incredibly helpful.
